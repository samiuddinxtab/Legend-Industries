# Success Definition & Measurement Boundaries

## Purpose of This File

This document defines what “success” means for the website and, equally important, what does NOT matter.

Its role is to:
- Prevent false optimization
- Prevent analytics misuse
- Prevent feature creep driven by vanity metrics
- Give humans and AI a shared definition of “working”

If a metric is not defined here, it must not influence decisions.

---

## Core Principle

The website is not a growth engine.
It is a **credibility filter and qualification layer**.

Therefore:
- Fewer, better enquiries are preferable to higher volume.
- Calm, stable operation is preferable to constant optimization.
- Non-actionable data is considered noise.

## Primary Success Metric (Single Source of Truth)

### **Qualified Enquiries per Month**

A “qualified enquiry” is defined as a contact submission where:
- The sender represents an organization or bulk individual requirement
- The message includes context (quantity, product type, purpose)
- The enquiry aligns with manufacturing, customization, or bulk supply
- The enquiry does NOT ask for single-unit pricing

This is the only metric that ultimately matters.

---

## Secondary Success Metrics (Supporting Only)

These metrics exist to **explain** outcomes, not to drive them.

### 1. Source Quality
- Which traffic sources produce qualified enquiries
- Organic search vs direct vs referrals

Used for:
- Deciding whether advertising is worth exploring
- Understanding visibility gaps

Not used for:
- Daily monitoring
- Content churn

---

### 2. Form Completion Rate
- Percentage of visitors who start and complete the contact form

Used for:
- Detecting form friction
- Identifying obvious UX issues

Not used for:
- Copywriting experiments
- CTA optimization theatrics

---

### 3. Search Visibility Signals
- Google Search Console impressions
- Queries triggering impressions
- Average position trends

Used for:
- Ensuring digital legibility
- Detecting if the site is indexed correctly

Not used for:
- Chasing keywords
- Blogging strategies
- Content expansion

---

## Metrics Explicitly Declared as Non-Goals

The following metrics must be ignored, even if available:

- Total traffic volume
- Page views
- Time on site
- Bounce rate
- Scroll depth
- Social shares
- Returning visitor rate
- Visual engagement metrics

Optimizing for these would actively harm the project.

## Analytics Scope (Intentional Limitation)

Analytics is used only to answer:
- “Are the right people finding us?”
- “Are they contacting us with clarity?”

Analytics is NOT used to:
- Personalize content
- Track individuals
- Retarget visitors
- Profile behavior

This limitation is deliberate.

---

## Advertising Readiness (Boundary Definition)

Advertising is considered **eligible for exploration** only if ALL are true:

- Organic enquiries are consistently qualified
- At least 5 qualified enquiries per month occur organically
- Source patterns are stable for 2–3 months
- The business has capacity to handle additional enquiries

Until then:
- No ad optimization
- No conversion tuning
- No remarketing

---

## Success Timeline Expectation

This website is not expected to show immediate results.

Healthy outcomes look like:
- Gradual improvement in enquiry clarity
- Reduced irrelevant contact
- Increased confidence during procurement conversations

Silence or low volume in early months is not failure.

---

## Failure Indicators (Actionable)

Intervention is required if:
- Retail or single-unit enquiries dominate
- Enquiries lack context repeatedly
- The form attracts spam or low-quality messages
- The site creates pressure to “add more content”
- Stakeholders ask for features to increase traffic

These indicate drift away from the core problem definition.

---

## Final Constraint

No metric, dashboard, or report may override:
- The problem definition (`00_problem.md`)
- The qualification-first philosophy

If metrics suggest a change that contradicts those, the metrics are wrong.
