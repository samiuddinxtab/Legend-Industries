# Problem Definition & Reality Grounding

## Purpose of This File

This document defines the real-world problem this website exists to solve.

It is not a marketing document.

It is not a feature list.

Its sole purpose is to anchor all future decisions — design, content, technology, and AI prompts — in verified business reality.

If any future idea, page, feature, or line of copy contradicts this document, that idea is considered invalid by default.

## Nature of the Business (As It Actually Operates)

Legend Industries is a **manufacturing-backed supply business**.

Core activities include:
- In-house manufacturing of bags (corporate, institutional, bulk-use categories)
- Custom branding and customization (printing, engraving, related methods)
- Supplying manufactured and sourced **utility merchandise** as part of bulk requirements
- Fulfilling corporate gifting and institutional supply orders

Products handled in practice include (non-exhaustive):
- Bags (backpacks, laptop bags, duffle bags, side bags, briefcases)
- Water bottles
- Diaries and similar utility stationery
- Containers and related items
- Printing and branding work associated with bulk orders

The business operates through **context-based procurement**, not fixed catalogs.

---

## Buyer Reality (Critical Clarification)

The business is **B2B-dominant**, but not B2B-exclusive.

It serves:
- Organizations (companies, trusts, institutions, schools, NGOs)
- Bulk individual requirements (events, functions, personal bulk gifting)

These buyers share common behavior:
- They purchase in bulk quantities
- They expect customization
- They understand that pricing depends on volume, materials, and branding
- They are comfortable with discussion-based procurement
- They often operate with GST invoices, even when not traditional corporates

This is **not retail** and **not wholesale** in the ecommerce sense.

## The Real Problem (Not the Superficial One)

The superficial problem is “we do not have a website”.

The real problem is **digital illegibility**.

In modern procurement, suppliers are filtered before contact through:
- Google search
- AI tools
- Internal vendor vetting
- Basic credibility checks

Without a clear, restrained, factual website:
- The business is silently excluded from consideration
- Procurement teams cannot justify initiating contact
- Serious buyers move on without engaging

The cost is not missed leads.
The cost is **non-consideration**.

## Who the Website Is For (Explicit)

The website exists for buyers who:
- Represent an organization or a bulk individual requirement
- Are evaluating suppliers, not browsing products
- Understand customization, MOQ, and context-based pricing
- Need to verify legitimacy, scope, and seriousness
- Prefer controlled, professional communication

The website supports decision-making, not shopping.

---

## Who the Website Is NOT For (Non-Negotiable)

The website must actively filter out:
- Retail customers seeking single units
- Price-only shoppers
- Users expecting instant quotes or catalogs
- Casual gift browsers
- Ecommerce-style expectations (add to cart, checkout)
- Users seeking chat support or daily follow-ups

If these users do not contact the business, the website is functioning correctly.

---

## What the Website Must Do

At minimum, the website must:
- Establish legal and operational legitimacy
- Clearly communicate manufacturing-backed capability
- Define scope without listing SKUs or prices
- Signal seriousness, stability, and constraint
- Provide a single, controlled contact path for qualified enquiries
- Reduce unqualified inbound noise

The website is a **filter**, not a funnel.

---

## What the Website Must Not Attempt

The website must not:
- Tell brand stories or founder journeys
- Use emotional or inspirational marketing language
- Mimic ecommerce platforms
- Educate the general public
- Chase traffic volume
- Add features “just in case”
- Create pressure for frequent updates

Any of the above increases noise and reduces trust.

---

## Definition of Success

The website is successful if:
- Incoming enquiries are fewer but more qualified
- Conversations start at a higher level of clarity
- Procurement teams can internally justify contacting the business
- The business experiences no ongoing maintenance pressure
- The site remains stable for long periods without changes

Visual appeal and engagement metrics are secondary.

---

## Definition of Failure

The website has failed if:
- Retail enquiries dominate
- Visitors ask for prices without context
- The site feels like a gift shop
- Content drifts toward promotional language
- New pages are added to “look active”
- Features are added without clear justification
- The business must adapt its operations to fit the website

Failure increases cognitive load instead of reducing it.

---

## Core Constraint (Immutable)

This website exists to reflect an existing operational reality.

The website must adapt to the business.
The business must never adapt to the website.
