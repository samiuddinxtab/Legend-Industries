# Scope Definition, Constraints & Permanent Boundaries

## Purpose of This File

This document exists to prevent scope creep.

It defines, in unambiguous terms:
- What this website is allowed to do
- What it must never attempt
- What future expansion depends on
- Which decisions are permanently banned

This file has higher authority than feature requests, design ideas, or analytics data.

If any future request conflicts with this file, the request is rejected by default.

---

## Core Scope Definition

This website is a **static, credibility and qualification layer** for an existing manufacturing-backed business.

Its scope is limited to:
- Explaining capability
- Establishing legitimacy
- Defining engagement boundaries
- Enabling controlled contact for qualified buyers

The website is not a growth engine, marketplace, or sales automation tool.

---

## What the Website Explicitly DOES

The website is allowed to:

- Present the business as a manufacturing-backed supplier
- Describe categories of items handled (bags, bottles, diaries, utility merchandise)
- Explain customization and branding capability
- Indicate bulk-oriented operations
- Serve organizational and bulk individual buyers
- Display verified legal and contact information
- Explain the engagement and production process
- Accept structured enquiries through a single contact channel

All allowed actions must support **clarity and filtering**, not persuasion.

---

## What the Website Explicitly DOES NOT Do

The website must never:

- Display product catalogs or SKU listings
- Publish prices, rate cards, or estimates
- Support ecommerce flows (cart, checkout, payments)
- Offer instant quotes or calculators
- Provide retail-style browsing
- Present single-unit purchasing paths
- Use testimonials without formal verification
- Run promotions, offers, or campaigns
- Attempt lead nurturing or remarketing
- Introduce chatbots or instant messaging as primary contact
- Encourage frequent content updates

These are permanent exclusions unless this file is formally revised.

---

## Retail and Wholesale Boundary (Critical)

The website must not:
- Position the business as retail
- Position the business as wholesale distribution

Instead, it must remain clearly positioned as:
- **Bulk, requirement-driven supply**
- **Customization and manufacturing-oriented**
- **Procurement-aligned**

Any UI, copy, or feature that resembles retail or wholesale behavior is a violation of scope.

---

## B2C Constraint (Clarified)

The website allows **bulk individual requirements** only.

This includes:
- Events
- Programs
- Institutional-like individual buyers

The website must not:
- Encourage casual individual purchases
- Attract single-unit buyers
- Offer consumer-style convenience

Bulk is the non-negotiable qualifier.

---

## Content Expansion Rules

New pages may be added only if:
- They directly reduce unqualified enquiries, or
- They clarify scope for serious buyers

New pages must not be added:
- To increase traffic
- To appear active
- For SEO experimentation
- For branding or storytelling

Every new page requires justification against this file.

---

## Phase-Based Expansion Triggers (Hard Gates)

The following features are allowed **only if specific conditions are met**.

### Case Studies
Allowed only when:
- At least 5 documented projects exist
- Projects represent different buyer types
- Claims can be verified or anonymized safely

### Advanced Analytics
Allowed only when:
- Qualified enquiries are consistent
- There is a clear decision problem to solve
- Data will be acted upon, not observed

### CMS Introduction
Allowed only when:
- Updates become frequent (weekly or more)
- A non-technical editor is required
- Security and maintenance capacity exists

### Advertising Integration
Allowed only when:
- Organic enquiry quality is proven
- Capacity exists to handle increased volume
- Messaging consistency is stable

Until conditions are met, these remain out of scope.

---

## Permanently Out-of-Scope Items (Never)

The following are never allowed under any circumstances:

- Full ecommerce functionality
- Dynamic pricing engines
- Consumer accounts or logins
- Loyalty programs
- Social media feeds
- Blog content for traffic growth
- “About us” storytelling expansions
- Visual redesigns for trend alignment

These violate the core problem definition.

---

## Enforcement Rule

Any stakeholder (human or AI) proposing a change must answer:

1. Does this reduce unqualified enquiries?
2. Does this improve buyer clarity?
3. Does this preserve low maintenance and stability?

If any answer is “no”, the change is rejected.

---

## Final Constraint

The website must remain boring, stable, and predictable.

Any increase in complexity must be justified by a clear reduction in operational friction.
