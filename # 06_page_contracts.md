# Page-Level Contracts & Content Boundaries

## Purpose of This File

This document defines a binding contract for each page on the website.

Its role is to:
- Prevent page-level drift
- Stop retail, marketing, or storytelling behavior from leaking in
- Give developers, AI, and editors an unambiguous checklist
- Ensure each page does one job and one job only

If content on a page violates its contract, the content is wrong even if it “looks good”.

---

## Global Page Rules (Apply to All Pages)

Across the entire website:

- No pricing information
- No product SKUs
- No testimonials
- No promotional language
- No urgency-based CTAs
- No “why choose us” sections
- No emotional storytelling
- No decorative content blocks

All pages must:
- Use factual, operational language
- Be readable without scrolling excessively
- Support validation, not persuasion

---

## PAGE 1 — HOME (`/`)

### Constitutional Purpose
Immediate legitimacy and scope validation.

The Home page exists to answer, within seconds:
“Is this a real, suitable supplier for bulk organizational or individual requirements?”

---

### Required Content Elements

- Positioning statement (from `02_positioning.md`)

### Explicitly Forbidden on Home

- Detailed explanations
- Long text sections
- CTAs such as “Get a quote”, “Call now”, “Order now”
- Contact forms
- Testimonials or logos
- Feature grids or comparisons

Home must remain calm, sparse, and factual.

---

## PAGE 3 — PROCESS (`/process`)

### Constitutional Purpose
Reduce uncertainty by explaining **how engagement typically works**.

### Explicitly Forbidden on Process

- Guaranteed timelines

- Operational details that could be misinterpreted as promises

This page must feel predictable, not aggressive.

---

### CTA Rule
No CTA beyond a neutral reference to the Contact page.

---

## Cross-Page Consistency Rule

- Tone must not change between pages
- Terminology must remain consistent
- No page may attempt to compensate for another page’s role

Each page does its job or not at all.

---

## Enforcement Rule

Any content addition must answer:
- Does this belong on this page?
- Does this reduce ambiguity?
- Does this respect the page’s constitutional purpose?

If not, it must be removed.

---

## Final Constraint

Pages are contracts, not canvases.

Breaking a page contract breaks trust.
